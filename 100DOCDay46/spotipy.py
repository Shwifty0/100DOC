"""
I accidentally deleted the interpreter I was using this whole time.
I have brought upon a new set of challenges for myself now

1. First do a clean install of Python
2. Set up a new environment for 100-doc-code
3. Install the dependecies and start working on the project.

Note: The streak is going on but no real coding was done... I'm sad cus my routine is not an optimal one
I'm going to priortize my sleep today. and wake up early.
